# Projects
## A B2B SaaS startup offers project‑management software on monthly and annual subscriptions. Management is worried about rising customer churn and wants to:

#### 1)Measure churn and revenue impact accurately

#### 2)Understand key drivers of churn

#### 3)Build a model to flag at‑risk customers for retention campaigns.

## A customer is considered churned in month t if:

#### (1) their subscription is cancelled/expired with no renewal, or

#### (2) they have had no payments and no product activity for at least 60 days by the end of month t.

Using this definition, we calculate both customer churn rate and revenue churn rate monthly
